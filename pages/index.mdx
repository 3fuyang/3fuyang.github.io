# Hi there 👋

This is my personal blog, basically including 4 modules:

+ 📑 **Blog** - Some technical articles.
+ 📓 **Notes** - Notes about vanilla JS APIs.
+ ✏️ **Essay** - Yep, just essays.
+ 💻 **Projects** - Simple introduction of my projects.
+ ⌨️ **Demos** - Also projects, but much smaller and simpler.
