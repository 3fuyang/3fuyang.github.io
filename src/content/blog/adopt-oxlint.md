# Adopt Oxlint

Recently, I started exploring with [oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html), the increasingly popular JavaScript linter in the community, especially for its ability of replacing [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), which tends to be a performance bottleneck during CI runs for large projects.

During the integration, I am definitely impressed with the extreme performance of this Rust-based linter, but also find that the current docs of oxlint are sometimes ambiguous and example-lacking. I take the chance to write down some notes for future reference and wish it could help others who are also interested in trying new JavaScript toolings.

## Installation

Well, this is not the most interesting part. Reference the [installation guide](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html#installation) and you will be good to go.

## Configuration

Without any configuration, 91 rules are enabled with oxlint by default, which are marked with ✅ in [rules](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules.html#rules).

### Plugins

Oxlint continuously implements [new rules](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/481) from various existing high-quality projects in the community, such as [`eslint-plugin-unicorn`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-unicorn), [`eslint-plugin-jest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jest), etc. Some of the rule sets are enabled by default, like `eslint-plugin-unicorn` and [`eslint-plugin-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react), while some are not, like `eslint-plugin-jest` and [`eslint-plugin-import`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import), which require manual opt-in via options listed in [enable plugins](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/cli.html#enable-plugins).

### The OXC Rules

As a base toolchain for future JavaScript projects, Oxlint does not only copy/paste existing eslint rules, but also develops its own brand new linting rules, which are labeled with `source: oxc` in the [rules](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules.html#rules) documentation.

While these rules seem really attractive, they are not well documented in the docs yet. To figure out the behavior of a specific rule from `oxc`, you have to dive into the source code of `oxlint`. Luckily, in its codebase, `oxlint` provides **snapshot** tests for each rule, which serves as a really good reference for understanding what the rule does for our project.

Take the rule `misrefactored-assign-op` as an example, it is placed in the [suspicious](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules.html#suspicious-14) category and is not enabled by default. To figure out what it does, we could navigate to the [source code](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc) of `oxc`, and simply search "misrefactored-assign-op" in the codebase, then we will find the snapshot file [`misrefactored_assign_op.snap`](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/blob/adee7280d74a05e5443630ee52ee7b42017489b4/crates/oxc_linter/src/snapshots/misrefactored_assign_op.snap#L4) generated by the test case of the rule, the content of which is listed below:

```snap
---
source: crates/oxc_linter/src/tester.rs
---
  ⚠ oxc(misrefactored-assign-op): Misrefactored assign op. Variable appears on both sides of an assignment operation
   ╭─[misrefactored_assign_op.tsx:1:1]
 1 │ a += a + 1;
   · ──────────
   ╰────
  help: Did you mean `a += 1`?
```

We can clearly see what the rule is about now, and this approach could be applied to other `oxc` rules as well.

### The Vitest Plugin

If you use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as your test runner, you will be happy when seeing that a `--vitest-plugin` option appears in the [enable plugins](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/cli.html#enable-plugins) section. However, besides this command line interface option, **no further** detailed documentation is provided on how exactly to use this plugin, especially when there's not a single rule labeled with `source: vitest` showing up in the [rules](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules.html) doc.

In fact, the rules of `vitest` plugin are completely documented with a label of `source: jest` instead, which is quite confusing if the user does not know well about the relation between `vitest` and `jest`, where the former gets many enlightenments from the latter.

So when you run `oxlint` with `--vitest-plugin`, what you need to reference with are the rules labeled with `source: jest`, and before enabling a rule, remember to check whether it's also included in
[`eslint-plugin-vitest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-vitest). This seems really counter-intuitive, but it's the current status of the documentation.

## VSCode Extension

Oxlint provides an official VSCode extension to provide a better development experience, yet the default configuration file path is set to `.eslinrc` rather than the `.oxlintrc.json` mentioned in [configuration file](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/config.html). This could complicate integration with collaborative projects, as each developer would need to configure the extension for custom settings.

## Functionality and Robustness

The performance of `oxlint` is extraordinary, really. But during my integration, I found that its automatic fix sometimes goes wrong and completely clear a file, which is a functionality problem.

Also, when executing `oxlint` multiple times in a terminal, it sometimes stuck during generating the report, thus causing the entire VSCode to freeze.

## Conclusion

Anyway, `oxlint` is still a promising project for me, and many next-generation projects are being built on top of it, such as [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/), the future bundler for Vite. It does have some rough edges on documentation and umbrella features, but I believe the community will help to polish it in the near future.
