- [Using callbacks to achieve better component decoupling in React | Dario's Blog](https://darios.blog/posts/using-callbacks-in-react) - Basic, very.
- [Vertical-Align: All You Need To Know (CSS)](https://christopheraue.net/design/vertical-align) - Really helpful, specs are the best learning material.
- [Microfrontends should be your last resort](https://www.breck-mckye.com/blog/2023/05/Microfrontends-should-be-your-last-resort/) - Totally agree, "Decouple before you isolate".
