I was wandering around the [discuss.Codemirror](https://discuss.codemirror.net/) site, and I saw an opinion from the library author [marijn](https://discuss.codemirror.net/u/marijn/summary):

![(Or, what I recommend, unless you are heavily reliant on some yarn-specific feature, is to stop using yarn. At this point, npm is superior again.) - marijn](../../assets/npm-is-superior-again/quote.png)

Although I've not used yarn for a really long time, I still feel the pain of using npm. Maybe I should learn about latest npm features.
